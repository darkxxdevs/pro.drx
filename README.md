**Note: This project has been discontinued and is no longer actively maintained.**

## Introduction

This Next.js application was designed to track and monitor the prices of products on various websites through web scraping. It allowed users to add product URLs, schedule periodic scraping tasks, and receive notifications when prices changed. However, due to several reasons, this project has been discontinued.

## Reasons for Discontinuation

The project was discontinued for the following reasons:

1. **Legality and Ethics**: Web scraping can potentially violate the terms of service of websites and may be considered unethical. It's important to respect website policies and legal regulations.

2. **Technological Challenges**: Maintaining a reliable web scraping solution can be challenging. Websites often change their structure, which can break scraping scripts and require constant updates.

3. **Resource Intensive**: Web scraping can be resource-intensive, especially when scraping large amounts of data. This can strain server resources and lead to performance issues.

4. **Alternative Solutions**: There are alternative solutions for price tracking, such as using APIs provided by e-commerce websites or third-party services, which are more reliable and sustainable.

## Project Structure

Although the project is discontinued, you can still review the codebase and learn from it. Here's an overview of the project's structure:

- `src/`: Contains the Next.js application code.
- `public/`: Includes static assets like images and styles.
- `pages/`: Contains Next.js pages and routing logic.
- `components/`: Includes React components used throughout the application.
- `lib/`: Contains utility functions and configurations.
- `scripts/`: May contain web scraping scripts, if applicable.
